Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder,
and why you made those changes.

    Changed the type that represents nodes and edge labels from String to generic types to make the class generic
    In Graph and MarvelTestDriver, changed Graph and Edge declaration to accommodate to the changes,
        including writing a comparator for edges used in sort() because generic type fields cannot use the default
        comparator like String.
