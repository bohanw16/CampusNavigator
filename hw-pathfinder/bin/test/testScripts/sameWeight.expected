# test a graph that has two paths of equal weight

created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g
added node n4 to g

added edge 1.111 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge 2.222 from n1 to n3 in g
added edge 2.222 from n2 to n4 in g
added edge 1.111 from n3 to n4 in g

path from n1 to n4:
n1 to n2 with weight 1.111
n2 to n4 with weight 2.222
total cost: 3.333
