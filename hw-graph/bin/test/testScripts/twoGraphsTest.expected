# twoGraphs testing file
# Tests that two graph can be created,
# two nodes can be added to the first graph,
# two nodes can be added to the second graph,
# an edge can be added to the first graph,
# an edge can be added to the second graph,
# and the node lists and children lists can be printed out correctly

# Create a graph g1
created graph g1

# Add two nodes to g1
added node n1 to g1
added node n2 to g1

# Add an edge to g1
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g1

# Print the node in g1 and the children of n1
g1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in g1 are: n2(e1)

# Create a graph g2
created graph g2

# Add two nodes to g2
added node n3 to g2
added node n4 to g2

# Add an edge to g2
added edge e2 from n3 to n4 in g2

# Print the node in g2 and the children of n3
g2 contains: n3 n4
the children of n3 in g2 are: n4(e2)
