# twoNodesTwoEdges testing file
# Tests that a graph can be created,
# two nodes can be added to the graph,
# and two edges can be added in the same path

# Create a graph
created graph g1

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to g1
added node n2 to g1

# Add two edges in the same path
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in g1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the children of n1
g1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in g1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2)
