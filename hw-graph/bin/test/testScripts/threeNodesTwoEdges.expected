# threeNodesTwoEdges testing file
# Tests that a graph can be created,
# three nodes can be added to the graph,
# and two edges between them can be added

# Create a graph
created graph g1

# Add three nodes
added node n1 to g1
added node n2 to g1
added node n3 to g1

# Add two edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g1
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in g1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the children of n1 and n2
g1 contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in g1 are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in g1 are: n3(e2)
