# twoGraphs testing file
# Tests that two graph can be created,
# two nodes can be added to the first graph,
# two nodes can be added to the second graph,
# an edge can be added to the first graph,
# an edge can be added to the second graph,
# and the node lists and children lists can be printed out correctly

# Create a graph g1
CreateGraph g1

# Add two nodes to g1
AddNode g1 n1

# Add an edge to g1
AddEdge g1 n1 n2 e1

# Print the node in g1 and the children of n1
ListNodes g1
