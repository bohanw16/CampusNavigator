# cycleGraph testing file
# Tests that a graph can be created,
# 2 nodes can be added to the graph,
# and 2 edges can be added to 2 node to form a cycle

# Create a graph
created graph g1

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to g1
added node n2 to g1

# Add an edge for one edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in g1

# Print the node in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
g1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in g1 are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in g1 are: n1(e2)
