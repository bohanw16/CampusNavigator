Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel,
and why you made those changes.

    1. getChildren():
        If the given parent node doesn't exist, return null instead of throwing exception; avoid Exception throwing.
        Changed the return value from a map that maps from child nodes to edge labels to a list of outgoing edges;
        mapping children to outgoing edges is unnecessary because children nodes can be derived from edges.
        Changed the JUnite test of getChildren so it's consistent with the change.
