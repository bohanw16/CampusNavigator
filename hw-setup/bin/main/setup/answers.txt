## Part 6

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    The first condition of the if-else blocks incorrectly included n = 0.
    The condition of "if (n <= 0)" should be changed to "if (n < 0)".

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    When n == 0, Fibonacci was supposed to return 1 but threw an exception instead.
    Since we exclude 0 from the first condition and include it in the second condition
    where it returns 1, we did not need to change anything after we fixed the first part.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    Since n == 2 was not supposed to be a base case, it was incorrectly included in
    the second condition instead of the third. So we need to change the
    "else if (n <= 2)" to "else if (n < 2)". Additionally, Fibonacci should get the
    sum of the previous two digits instead of the difference. So we need to change the
    "return getFibTerm(n - 1) - getFibTerm(n - 2);" to
    "return getFibTerm(n - 1) + getFibTerm(n - 2);".
